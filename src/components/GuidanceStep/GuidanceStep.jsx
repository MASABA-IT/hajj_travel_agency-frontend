                Upon reaching the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, pilgrims perform
                Tawaf, which involves walking seven times around the Kaaba in a
                counterclockwise direction. This ritual represents the
                commitment to Allah and the solidarity of Muslims.

                After Tawaf, pilgrims perform Sai, walking seven times between
                the hills of Safa and Marwah. This commemorates the actions of
                Hajar, the wife of Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon them), who
                searched for water for her son Ismail in the exact location.

                Halaq refers to the act of shaving or trimming the hair after
                completing the Hajj pilgrimage, a mandatory religious duty for
                Muslims who are physically and financially able to undertake it.
                For those, who choose not to shave their heads completely,
                trimming a portion of the hair is also acceptable.{" "}

                Throughout the Umrah journey, prayers and supplications hold
                great significance. Pilgrims are encouraged to spend time in
                reflection, asking for forgiveness, and making sincere prayers
                for themselves, their families, and the entire Muslim community.
